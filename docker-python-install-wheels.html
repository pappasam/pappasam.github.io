  <div>
    <p>If your Docker Python build requires system dependencies that are NOT required
at runtime, structure your build as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">multi-stage build</a></li>
<li>Stage 1 installs system dependencies and uses them to build local <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonwheels.com/">wheels</a></li>
<li>Stage 2 begins from the same base as Stage 1, copies wheels from
Stage 1, and installs the wheels</li>
<li>The rest of your build will be based on Stage 2</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow these steps, you'll end up with the smallest-possible Python
Docker container with all your Python dependencies intact.</p>

<p>Note: this post references Docker 18.03, Python 3.6, and pip 10. I assume that
you are running <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a> (Python's reference implementation).</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>We want to do a Python system build using Docker. Python system builds often
require installing third-party code. This third-party code may contain code or
resources that must be compiled during their installation. For simplicity's
sake, assume we are talking about source code in the C programming language.
Since a Docker container will be our &quot;target machine&quot;, we'll need a C compiler
in our Docker container. Unfortunately, C compilers are large programs. Since
we plan to scale our number of containers up and down based on the demand for
its provided service, the image should ideally be as small as possible.</p>
<p>Basically, we want to build C code with a C compiler and then throw away the C
compiler to save space in our deployment image.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following examples should clarify the problem and its resolution. Note: I'm
assuming that you're using a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a>-inspired system.</p>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h3>Setup</h3>

<div class="section" id="example-1-broken-build-requiring-a-c-compiler">
<h3>Example 1: broken build requiring a C compiler</h3>
<p>We have a simple, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint">entrypoint</a>-less Docker container in which we must install
<a class="reference external" href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uWSGI</a>. In the uWSGI <a class="reference external" href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html">quickstart</a> guide, its developers clarify that it &quot;is a
(big) C application, so you need a C compiler (like gcc or clang) and the
Python development headers&quot;.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into a file called &quot;Dockerfile.break&quot;:</p>
<pre class="code docker highlight literal-block">
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> python:3.6-alpine as breakimage</span>

<p>Now run the following shell command in the same directory as your
Dockerfile.break.</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">

</pre>
<p>Consistent with the uWSGI documentation, our system has said that we &quot;need a C
compiler to build uWSGI&quot;. We'll do that in example 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-2-large-build-with-c-compiler-installed">
<h3>Example 2: large build with C compiler installed</h3>
<p>In this example, we'll install our system dependencies so uWSGI can actually be
built.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into a file called &quot;Dockerfile.big&quot;:</p>
<pre class="code docker highlight literal-block">
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> python:3.6-alpine as bigimage</span>

<span class="k">RUN</span> apk add --no-cache linux-headers g++

<span class="k">RUN</span> pip install uwsgi
</pre>
<p>Now run the following shell command:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
make build-big
</pre>
<p>In the &quot;build-big&quot; make target, I've included a command to list all Docker
images on your system. Because of this command, you should see something close
to the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block">
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED                  SIZE

python              3.6-alpine          8eb1c554687d        16 hours ago             90.4MB
</pre>
<div class="section" id="the-good">
<h4>The good</h4>
<p>The image built successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bad">
<h4>The bad</h4>
<p>The image is unnecessarily large.</p>
<p>We're planning on scaling our web-service to handle a decent amount of traffic.
Scaling will involve deploying many images on many servers. Larger images take
longer to deploy and (obviously) take up more space than smaller images.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-ugly">
<h4>The ugly</h4>
<p>We are including an unnecessary dependency.</p>
<p>We don't need a C compiler in the image, so the C compiler is an unnecessary
dependency.  Including an unnecessary dependency in our runtime image is a
horrible design, similar to including an unnecessary Python dependency in our
requirements.txt or setup.py. As great software developers, we HATE bad system
design, so let's find a way to resolve the &quot;bad&quot; and the &quot;ugly&quot; while
preserving the &quot;good&quot;!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-3-failed-attempt-at-simply-uninstalling-c-compiler">
<h3>Example 3: failed attempt at simply &quot;uninstalling&quot; C compiler</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, if we want to reduce our image size, we cannot simply
&quot;uninstall&quot; the C compiler. For reasons that I do not fully comprehend at this
time, Docker caches anything you install in an image, so uninstalling a
dependency does NOT reduce the image size.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into a file called &quot;Dockerfile.uninstall&quot;:</p>
<pre class="code docker highlight literal-block">
<span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> python:3.6-alpine as bigimage-uninstalled</span>

<span class="k">RUN</span> apk add --no-cache linux-headers g++

<span class="k">RUN</span> pip install uwsgi

<span class="k">RUN</span> apk del linux-headers g++
</pre>
<p>Now run the following shell command:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
make build-uninstall-big
</pre>
<p>You should see something close to the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block">
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED                  SIZE

blog-python         big                 8a68d0dad407        11 minutes ago           251MB

</pre>
<p>Our efforts at removing our C compiler proved futile. At this point, lesser
developers would give up and assume we've reached the end of the road. But you,
dear reader, are reading my blog, and I know you're better than that! Let's dig
deeper and find an elegant way shrink our Docker image!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-4-small-final-build-without-c-compiler">
<h3>Example 4: small final build without C compiler</h3>
<p>This final example results in a small image with uWSGI installed and without a
C compiler. It relies heavily on multi-stage builds and on pip wheels.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into a file called &quot;Dockerfile.small&quot;:</p>
<pre class="code docker highlight literal-block">
<span class="c">###########################################</span>
<span class="c"># Throwaway image with C compiler installed</span>

</span>      uwsgi
</pre>
<p>Now run the following shell command:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
make build-small
</pre>
<p>You should see something close to the following in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block">
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

</pre>
<p>Notice that the image tagged &quot;small&quot; is ~61% smaller than its &quot;big&quot;
counterparts. It has 7 additional MB from its base alpine container. These
megabytes represent only the uWSGI library itself. We'll need to make
modifications to uWSGI itself to get any smaller. I leave uWSGI modifications
as an exercise for the reader.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="explanation">
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Two key points are responsible for our Docker build's success:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reliance on copying between image stages in Docker multi-stage
builds. This gets around caching problems with a single image</li>
<li>Understanding the difference between &quot;pip install&quot; and &quot;pip wheel&quot;</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="copying-betwen-docker-build-stages-in-multi-stage-build">
<h3>Copying betwen Docker build stages in multi-stage build</h3>
<p>Unless we explicitly specify a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-target-build-stage---target">--target</a>, Docker multi-stage builds will tag
their last stage. Downstream build stages can reference upstream build stages
and copy resources from them, similarly to how resources can be copied from any
local or remote file system into a traditional Docker container. Therefore, we
&quot;compile&quot; our Python code in one build stage and copy this compiled code in
another build stage. Since the code no longer needs to be compiled, we don't
need to a C compiler or Linux headers. As the coup de grâce, our build's final
stage is not based on any image with a C compiler installed, so this approach
completely avoids Docker's caching complexities.</p>
<p>Thanks to Docker's multi-stage builds, we are able to compile our Python
package and avoid deploying the build's system dependencies in our final image.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="difference-between-pip-install-and-pip-wheel">
<h3>Difference between &quot;pip install&quot; and &quot;pip wheel&quot;</h3>
<p>Docker multi-stage builds are cool and all, but I've seen many articles about
them. Python's packaging tool, <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a>, hasn't gotten as much careful attention
from the blogging community. Hopefully this section can clear up one common
point of confusion: <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/">pip install</a> vs <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_wheel/">pip wheel</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h4>pip install</h4>
<p>This is the command most people are familiar with. At a high level, it takes a
Python package, runs its setup.py, downloads and installs its dependencies, and
potentially does a lot more. Run &quot;pip install&quot; when you want to expand a
package's contents and use it as its author intended.</p>
<p>A good mental model: &quot;pip install&quot; takes a consolidated bundle of code / build
instructions and places the package's content and dependencies wherever they
need to go on an operating system. Once &quot;pip install&quot; runs on our machine, file
placement throughout our file system can be pretty <a class="reference external" href="http://stayhawaiian.blogspot.com/2010/05/hamajang.html">hamajang</a>, depending on a
package author's instructed in setup.py.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4>pip wheel</h4>
<p>This tool is mostly used by library developers wanting to distribute their
packages in a user-friendly way. For example, <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org">scikitlearn</a>, a popular Python
library for machine learning, requires <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html">a lot of system dependencies</a> to
build. Many Python users, especially data scientists, are either unwilling or
unable to install these dependencies on their host machines. This
user-characteristic led to unfortunate platforms like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/">Anaconda</a> (author
opinion). On a more mature note, for those of us with the appropriate
dependencies installed, the installation process would often take a very long
time; C, FORTRAN, and possibly other languages each needed to be compiled, and
installing code written in these languages often leads to a long coffee break.</p>
<p>Wheels enable Python developers to compile a package, and its dependencies, in
a distributable form targeting common operating system architectures. Today,
most scikitlearn users install it <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html">using its wheel</a>, which takes a fraction of
the time of the regular build process.</p>
<p>A good mental model: &quot;pip wheel&quot; takes a Python package, makes it ready to be
installed on any target machine WITHOUT its build dependencies, and puts it in
ONE easily-distributed archive file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-we-care-about-this">
<h4>Why we care about this?</h4>
<p>Not all Python packages are distributed as wheels. There are some packages,
based mostly on C, that are hard to compile once and use in many places. uWSGI
appears to be one of those packages. To build our final image, we construct
a throw-away container to construct a wheel for uWSGI.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When building a Docker container for a Python application, we can install
packages requiring build-time system dependencies AND remove these system
dependencies from our final Docker image through a combination of Docker
multi-stage builds, pip wheel, and pip install.</p>
